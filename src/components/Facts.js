            <h2> What is Color-Blindness </h2>
            <p>Color-blindness is the inability to distinguish the differences between certain colors.</p>
             <p>This condition results from an absence of color-sensitive pigment in the cone cells of the retina,</p>
             <p> the nerve layer at the back of the eye.</p>
            
            <p>Most color vision problems are inherited and are present at birth.</p>
            <p> Approximately 1 out of 12 males and 1 out of 20 women are color blind.</p>

            <h3> What does a color-blind person see? </h3>
            <p>A person with color-blindness has trouble seeing red, green, blue, or mixtures of these colors. </p>
            <p> The most common type is red-green color-blindness, where red and green are seen as the same color.</p>

            <h3>Here are some illustrations of the most common forms of color-blindness:</h3>
